    "In this project we'll analyze Data of New York City and its facilities. The purpose is to find business opportunities. Therefor we check what kind of facilites are in NYC and how popular they are. In the next step we will choose one kind of facility and search for good neighborhoods which are lacking of that kind of facility to open a new one. As you will see we decided to focus on restaurants, because its typical for New Yorker people to go out and eat instead of cooking for themselfs"
